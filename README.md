🚨 ResQ Connect - Disaster Management System

Bridging the gap between distressed citizens and emergency authorities.

ResQ Connect is a web-based disaster management and response coordination platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens in distress and emergency authorities. It facilitates real-time incident reporting, safe zone mapping, and data-driven decision-making to minimize response times during emergencies.

📸 Project Overview

Disasters require rapid information flow. ResQ Connect provides two distinct portals:

👤 Citizen Portal: For reporting incidents (Fire, Flood, Earthquake), viewing nearby shelters, accessing emergency hotlines, and reading safety guidelines.

👮 Admin Command Center: For authorities to visualize incoming reports, update incident statuses (e.g., "Rescue Sent"), manage safe zones, and view statistical analytics.

✨ Key Features

👤 Citizen Module

📍 Real-time Reporting: Report incidents with specific location and description.

🏠 Safe Zone Locator: View a list of nearby shelters, hospitals, and their capacity status (Open/Full).

🆘 Emergency SOS: One-click speed dial sidebar for Police (100), Fire (101), and Ambulance (108).

🚀 How to Execute the Project

Follow these steps exactly to run the project on your local machine.

✅ Prerequisites

Install XAMPP: Download and install from Apache Friends.

Visual Studio Code: Recommended editor.

1️⃣ Step 1: Deploy Files

Locate your XAMPP installation folder (usually C:\xampp).

Open the htdocs folder inside it.

Create a new folder named DisasterApp.

Copy your project's backend and frontend folders into this new folder.

Correct Path: C:\xampp\htdocs\DisasterApp\frontend\...

2️⃣ Step 2: Start the Server

Open XAMPP Control Panel.

Click Start next to Apache.

Click Start next to MySQL.

3️⃣ Step 3: Database Setup

Open your browser and go to: http://localhost/phpmyadmin

Click New on the left sidebar.

Create a database named: disaster_management

Click the SQL tab at the top.

Open the file backend/sql/schema.sql from your project folder.

Copy all the SQL code, paste it into the phpMyAdmin box, and click Go.

4️⃣ Step 4: Run in Browser

Open your web browser (Chrome/Edge).

Enter this URL:

http://localhost/DisasterApp/frontend/index.html


⚠️ Note: Do NOT use the "Live Server" extension in VS Code. It will not work with PHP. You must use the localhost URL.
